  - Root element is a section with id="hero".
  - Responsive grid: 1 column on small screens; 3 columns on large with the video spanning the right two-thirds.

SectionTwo — Metrics & Impact
- Description: Animated, glassy metrics section showing count-up tiles, a semi-circle gauge, and branded graph surfaces. Communicates measurable continuity benefits with motion and clarity.
- Anchor/Route: #metrics
- Structure:
  - Root element is a section with id="metrics".
  - Centered content via container-page with stacked, responsive grids:
    - Header with eyebrow, title, and caption.
    - Top row: semi-circle gauge card + 4 metric tiles (count-up).
    - Bottom row: knowledge-retained bars + onboarding-time reduction area chart.
- Behavior/Animations:
  - IntersectionObserver triggers once at 25% visibility to activate animations.
  - Count-up values animate 0 → target with ease-out cubic over ~1.3–1.5s.
  - Gauge uses an SVG semi-arc with stroke-dashoffset animation and brand gradient.
  - Bars animate heights in sequence with small delays; area chart reveals via clip-path.
- Styling:
  - Dark, glassmorphic graph surfaces with subtle grid ticks (graph-surface, grid-ticks, brand-glow).
  - Accent lines and fills use brand color sparingly; primary brand emphasis in CTA contexts only.
  - Cards use card/card--accent with thin borders and sharp rounding.
- Content (examples):
  - Gauge: “Knowledge locked in individuals” at 42% (animated).
  - Metric tiles:
    - Knowledge Retained — 92%
    - Days Faster Onboarding — 45
    - Weeks to Competency — 3
    - Answer Confidence — 96%
  - Graphs:
    - Knowledge Retained (progressive bars)
    - Onboarding Time Reduction (branded area chart)
- Accessibility:
  - Gauge includes an accessible <title> bound via aria-labelledby.
  - Animated numbers are readable and stabilized after animation completes.
- Implementation Notes:
  - Uses a local cn utility for className composition.
  - Ambient backdrop brand-tinted radial gradients are rendered behind content for depth.
  - Animations are client-only and run once per visit to prevent distraction.
- Import:
  - import { SectionTwo } from "@/components/sections/SectionTwo";
- Props:
  - None (section components do not accept props).
