## theMindArk.AI — Exit Strategy Echo Landing Page

A high-level, content-first plan for the marketing homepage that introduces Exit Strategy Echo: a modular system for capturing and preserving institutional knowledge by replicating an exiting employee as a digital assistant (“Echo”) and generating an onboarding playbook.

---

## Mission

Capture and preserve departing employees’ knowledge, then make it accessible:
- Echo: An AI assistant mirroring the exiting employee, available for teammates after the employee leaves.
- Onboarding Playbook: A clear, structured markdown document new hires can follow to learn the role quickly.

This page is the primary marketing landing and focuses on clarity, credibility, and conversion.

---

## Features

- Echo (AI Replica of Exiting Employee)
  - Mirrors the exiting employee’s knowledge and style.
  - Provides answers to role-specific questions after the employee departs.
  - Enables continuity across projects, processes, and tribal knowledge.

- Onboarding Playbook (Markdown)
  - A structured document capturing responsibilities, workflows, tools, and FAQs.
  - Clear, skimmable sections designed for day-one usability.
  - Becomes a living reference that complements the Echo.

- Hero Video Showcase
  - Immersive background/foreground interplay with text overlay.
  - Video placed on the right two-thirds of the hero; text runs on top of it.
  - Uses /videos/hero.mp4 and a modern, glassy dark theme presentation.

- Animated Impact Metrics (SectionTwo)
  - Graph values animate from 0 to their final values to illustrate impact.
  - Updated graph background colors to align with the app’s dark, glassmorphism styling and brand accents.

- Modern, Luxurious UI
  - Dark mode by default, gradient backgrounds, and glassmorphism.
  - Minimal, sharp rounding with subtle depth and motion.
  - Brand color #752E4F used sparingly for emphasis and primary CTAs.

- Static, Fast, Reliable
  - Built with React + Next.js (pages directory), statically generated for reliability and speed.
  - Tailwind v4 for consistent design system and responsive layout.

- Clear Calls-to-Action
  - Conversion-focused CTAs for “Get a Demo” and “See How It Works.”
  - Scannable content and anchor navigation for a concise single-page flow.

## Content Details

### Hero

- Layout
  - Video on the right two-thirds of the screen.
  - Headline and subheadline flow over the video (text overlays), ensuring legibility through a subtle dark gradient overlay and backdrop blur where needed.
  - The initial motif “Square with a circle inside of it” is represented as a framed, minimal geometric container for the video to hint at structure + human knowledge (“Echo”).
- Media
  - Video URL: /videos/hero.mp4
- Copy Direction
  - Headline: “Capture what they know. Keep it working.”
  - Subheadline: “Replicate departing employees as secure, AI-powered Echos and generate an onboarding playbook that lasts.”
  - Primary CTA: “Get a Demo”
  - Secondary CTA: “See How It Works”

### Features Overview

- Two stacked focus areas:
  - Echo — the AI replica available post-departure.
  - Onboarding Playbook — a structured, markdown-based guide for new hires.
- Each block includes a concise description and one supporting benefit.

### Echo (AI Assistant)

- Emphasis on mirroring knowledge, tone, and decision context of the exiting employee.
- Scenarios:
  - “What’s the escalation path for Vendor X?”
  - “How do we deploy the Q3 reporting pipeline?”
  - “Which stakeholders must approve this contract?”

### Onboarding Playbook

- Organized as markdown for portability and clarity.
- Example outline:
  - Role Overview
  - Core Responsibilities
  - Daily/Weekly/Monthly Routines
  - Key Systems and Access
  - Processes and SOPs
  - Stakeholders and Communication
  - FAQs and Troubleshooting

### Metrics & Impact (SectionTwo)

- Animation
  - All numeric values animate from 0 to their target to showcase momentum and impact.
  - Duration and easing tuned for legibility (e.g., 1.2–1.6s with smooth ease-out).
- Visual Style
  - Graph backgrounds updated to match the dark, glassmorphic palette.
  - Use brand color #752E4F sparingly for highlights, tick accents, or a thin border to call attention—not as a full graph fill except for a primary CTA chart.
- Sample Graphs
  - Knowledge Retained (% coverage)
  - Onboarding Time Reduction (days)
  - Time-to-Competency (weeks)
  - Answer Confidence (score)

### How It Works

- Step 1: Capture Knowledge
  - Interview prompts, document imports, and structured Q&A sessions with the exiting employee.
- Step 2: Create Echo + Playbook
  - Echo becomes the AI assistant; Playbook generates a clear reference for new hires.
- Step 3: Deploy to Team
  - Share Echo access and onboard new hires with the Playbook.

### CTA

- Strong, primary CTA using the brand color as a background.
- Secondary CTA link styled with a thin brand-colored border to indicate alternative action without competing.

### FAQ

- Example questions:
  - “What happens when the exiting employee is unavailable for clarifications?”
  - “Is the Echo limited to predefined topics?”
  - “How is the Playbook maintained over time?”

---

## Visual and Interaction Design

- Theme: Dark, modern, minimal, luxurious.
- Style: Glassmorphism with backdrop blur, subtle gradients, thin borders, and sharp corners.
- Color: Brand #752E4F reserved mainly for primary CTAs and tasteful borders.
- Motion: Gentle float animations for geometric accents and shimmer for interactive elements (e.g., CTA hover).
- Typography:
  - Hero headline: large, responsive (72px desktop, 48px mobile), with a gradient text treatment.
  - Subtitles and captions use semantic classes for hierarchy and readability.

---

## Technical and Implementation Notes

- Tech Stack
  - React, Next.js (pages directory), Tailwind v4, lucide-react.
  - Static Site Generation only; no server-side rendering.
- Layout Preferences
  - Stacking layouts with flex columns to avoid horizontal overflow.
  - Avoid long button labels; use icons when possible.
  - If buttons need text, do not enforce fixed widths.
- Structure
  - Single landing page at / with anchor-based sections for navigation.
  - No usage of the App Router; strictly the pages directory.
  - Named exports by default for components; Next.js pages export default as the page component.
- Styling
  - Apply gradient backgrounds and glass overlays with Tailwind utilities.
  - Maintain consistent dark scales, border opacities, and semantic text colors.
- Motion and Interaction
  - Animate metrics from 0 to final values on viewport intersection.
  - Update graph backgrounds to match dark/glass theme with subtle depth and contrast.

<coding-rules>
## Tech Stack
- ReactJS
- NextJS - pages directory and static site generation
- Tailwinds v4
- lucide-react - icons

## Layout
It is preferred to use stacking layouts using flex-box columns to avoid running out of horizontal
room. Avoid long names in buttons and prefer to use icons for buttons.

If buttons display text DO NOT give the button a static width.

## Static site generation
The frontend of the app uses static site generation so no server side rendering should be used. All
pages are stored in the pages directory and the NextJS app router is NOT used.

## Exports
Always use named exports unless explicitly told otherwise or required such as when creating NextJS
pages.


## Full screen screens
The `useFullPage` hook can be used to display a full screen page without the main navigation bar.

example:
``` tsx
import { useFullPage } from "@/lib/hooks";

function ExampleComponent(){

    useFullPage();

    return (
        <div></div>
    )
}
```

## Form Data
When creating forms store form data in a typed useState variable.

Zod schemas can be imported from `@/lib/schema` to validate types stored in the database.

Form state example:
``` tsx

interface NewsletterForm
{
    name:string
    email:string;
}
function ExampleComponent()
{
    const [newsletterData,setNewsletterData]=useState<NewsletterForm>({
        name:'',
        email:'',
    });

    return (
        <form>
            <input
                placeholder="Enter name"
                value={newsletterData.name}
                onChange={e=>setNewsletterData({...newsletterData,name:e.target.value})}
            />
            <input
                placeholder="Enter email"
                value={newsletterData.email}
                onChange={e=>setNewsletterData({...newsletterData,email:e.target.value})}
            />
        </form>
    )
}
```

## Pages
When creating NextJS pages export the page component as a default function with the function
name reflecting the name of the page.

Do not use the MainLayout component when creating a page. The Main Layout component will be
used by the top level App component.

Include the name of the page in the className of the root element of the page component using the
format of: "page--{PageComponentName}"

Example Page with a route of "/example":
``` tsx

export default function ExamplePage(){

    return (
        <div className="page--ExamplePage">
            Example page content
        <div>
    )
}
```

## Main Layout
The `MainLayout` component is used by the top level `App` component to render the main layout of the
app. By default the MainLayout should render pages in a centered column with a navigation bar.

### Main Layout Display modes
Pages can use the `useFullPage` and `useNoMargins` hooks to alter the way the page is displayed.
Implement display modes using css or class names, DO NOT change the render order or do anything
that would cause the page to be unmounted.

### Main Layout Fullscreen Mode
Pages can request to enter into fullscreen. Use the `useIsInFullPageMode` hook imported from 
`@/lib/hooks` to check if the page should be displayed in fullscreen mode. If useIsInFullPageMode
returns true hide the main navigation and any other UI other than the page content.

### Main Layout No Margins Mode
Pages can request to remove all page margins so that they can display content edge to edge. Use
the `useIsNoMarginMode` hook imported from `@/lib/hooks` to check if the page should be displayed
in no margins mode.


## Packages
This is the package.json file for the project. You can only use libraries based on the dependencies
of the package.json file.

``` json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lucide-react": "^0.544.0",
    "markdown-it": "^14.1.0",

### Logo
Displays the apps logo using an SVG

Import: `import { Logo } from "@/components/Logo";`
Props:
``` ts
interface LogoProps
{
    color?:string;
    /**
     * @default "w-8 h-8"
     */ 
    className?:string;
    size?:string|number;
}
```

## Utility Functions
The following utility functions can be imported from `@/lib/util`

``` ts
export type ClassNameValue = string | false | number | null | undefined | {
    [className: string]: any;
} | ClassNameValue[];

/**
 * Combines class names and ignores falsy values.
 */
export const cn=(...classNames:ClassNameValue[]):string=>;
```


## Hooks
React components can use the following hooks imported from `@/lib/hooks`

``` ts
/**
 * Hides common UI controls such as the main nav bar.
 * @param enabled If false the hook is disabled
 */
export const useFullPage=(enabled=true)=>;

/**
 * Removes all margins and paddings from the main layout while keeping the main navigation and
 * other shared UI elements
 * @param enabled If false the hook is disabled
 */
export const useNoMargins=(enabled=true)=>;

/**
 * Returns true if the page should be displayed in full screen
 */
export const useIsInFullPageMode=():boolean=>{
    const count=useSubject(fullPageSubject);
    return count>0;
}

/**
 * Returns true if the page should remove all margins
 */
export const useIsNoMarginMode=():boolean=>;
```
</coding-rules>

## Look and Feel
- modern luxurious
- glassmorphism
- minimalistic
- dark theme
- dark mode by default
- gradient backgrounds
- sharp, minimal rounding

## Custom Color Palette
- Brand color: #752E4F
- Dark scales: (50-900) for consistent theming
- Glass colors for translucent overlays
- Border colors with varying opacity levels
- Semantic text colors (primary, secondary, muted, etc.)

## Typography System
- Hero text styles with gradient effects
- Responsive sizing (72px desktop, 48px mobile)
- Letter spacing and weight variations
- Subtitle and caption utility classes

## Advanced Features
- Backdrop blur utilities (xs through xl)

theMindArk.AI Tailwind Theme — Style Guide

Overview
- Purpose: Guide engineers and designers to build the Exit Strategy Echo landing page using the provided Tailwind v4 theme and custom utilities/components.
- Principles: Dark, modern, luxurious; glassmorphism; minimal; gradient backgrounds; sharp rounding; brand used sparingly (mostly for CTAs and thin borders).

Setup
- Ensure globals.css (or equivalent global stylesheet) uses Tailwind v4 top-level imports and includes the provided theme and utilities (as in tailwind-theme).
- Typography plugin is already enabled in the theme; use the .prose class for long-form content.

File header (globals.css)
- Confirm this header is at the top of your global stylesheet:
```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300..900&family=Space+Grotesk:wght@400..700&display=swap");
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";
```

Design tokens and usage
- Brand: rgb(var(--color-brand)) => #752E4F; use for primary CTAs/backgrounds and subtle borders.
- Dark scales and surfaces: --color-ink-900 for backgrounds; glass surfaces via .glass, .glass-strong.
- Typography: Display font for hero via .text-hero and .headline-gradient; body via Inter.
- Motion: .animate-float / .animate-float-lg; shimmer for loading placeholders.

Core custom utilities/components (use directly in className)
- Layout and background: container-page, section-y, bg-page, bg-section, section-anchor
- Surfaces: glass, glass-strong, card (card--accent, card--ghost), hairline, border-strong, brand-border
- Typography: text-hero, headline-gradient, text-subtitle, text-caption, text-eyebrow, prose
- Buttons: btn, btn--primary, btn--secondary, btn--muted
- Inputs: input (input--invalid)
- Hero video: hero-frame, hero-video, hero-video__overlay
- Graphs: graph-surface, graph-accent, grid-ticks, brand-glow
- Helpers: focus-ring, divider, sr-only, container-page
- Layout modes (applied by layout when hooks are active): layout--fullpage, layout--no-margins

Rules and tips
- Use stacking layouts (flex-col) to avoid width overflow; prefer responsive blocks over wide grids.
- Brand color is reserved for primary CTAs and thin border accents; avoid large solid brand fills except CTA.
- For arbitrary values with spaces, replace spaces with underscores per Tailwind v4 rule.
- Utilities cannot contain pseudo-selectors; apply hover/focus/active at element level or rely on component styles.

Example: Page shell with anchors
```html
<!-- Home page wrapper (Next.js page root div should include page--{PageName}) -->
<div class="page--HomePage bg-page">
    <!-- Top-level container for content width -->
    <main class="container-page flex flex-col gap-16">
        <!-- Sections go here -->
    </main>
</div>
```

Hero section (video right two-thirds, text overlay on top)
```html
<section id="hero" class="section-anchor section-y">
    <div class="relative hero-frame grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 min-h-[520px]">

        <div class="col-span-1 lg:col-span-2 relative order-2 lg:order-2">
            <video class="hero-video" autoplay muted loop playsinline src="/videos/hero.mp4"></video>
            <div class="hero-video__overlay"></div>
        </div>

        <!-- Text overlay panel spans left third; overlay across video via absolute on small screens -->
        <div class="absolute inset-0 lg:static lg:col-span-1 order-1 lg:order-1 flex">
            <div class="flex flex-col justify-center gap-6 px-6 py-10 lg:px-8 lg:py-12 bg-[linear-gradient(90deg,rgba(0,0,0,0.65),rgba(0,0,0,0.25)_35%,transparent_65%)] lg:bg-transparent">

Brand usage guidance
- Use brand color primarily for:
  - btn--primary backgrounds
  - CTA surfaces (cta component)
  - Thin borders or highlights (brand-border, brand-glow) in non-CTA elements
- Avoid full brand fills on large areas except in primary CTA contexts (e.g., CTA card chart fill).

Arbitrary values with Tailwind v4
- Replace spaces with underscores. Example background image class:
```html
<div class='bg-[linear-gradient(180deg,rgba(255,255,255,0.06),rgba(255,255,255,0.03))]'></div>
```
- Use CSS variable color tokens where appropriate:
```html
<div class="border-[rgb(var(--color-brand)/0.35)]"></div>
<p class="text-[rgb(var(--color-text-secondary))]">Secondary text via theme token.</p>
```

Motion and micro-interactions
- Buttons already include hover/active behaviors and a shimmer on btn--primary.
- Use animate-float or animate-float-lg for small floating accents.
```html
<div class="card p-6 animate-float">
    <p class="text-caption">Subtle floating accent</p>
</div>
```

Hero motif (square with a circle inside)
- Use hero-frame and the overlay for legibility over video:
```html
<div class="hero-frame relative min-h-[360px]">
    <video class="hero-video" autoplay muted loop playsinline src="/videos/hero.mp4"></video>
    <div class="hero-video__overlay"></div>
    <!-- Place overlayed text in an absolutely positioned child if needed -->
</div>
```

Accessibility helpers
```html
<button class="btn btn--primary">
    <span class="sr-only">Open demo request form</span>
    Get a Demo
</button>
```

Composing sections with glass and gradients
```html
<section class="section-y bg-section">
    <div class="container-page">
        <div class="glass p-6 rounded-[var(--radius-sm)]">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Glassy Section</h3>
            <p class="text-caption">Use glass to elevate content without heavy contrast.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
```

Do and don’t
- Do: Keep layouts vertically stacked and responsive.
- Do: Use brand color sparingly; prefer borders and CTA backgrounds.
- Do: Rely on glass/gradients for depth and separation instead of heavy shadows.
- Don’t: Hardcode fixed button widths when using text.
- Don’t: Overuse brand fills or saturated gradients in non-CTA elements.

Implementation notes for this theme
- All classes in examples are ready to use with Tailwind v4 and the provided theme.
- Pseudo-classes should be applied on elements (e.g., hover:) or rely on component rules defined in the theme.
- For animated metrics, use a small client-side script to count from 0 to target when elements intersect the viewport; keep durations around 1.2–1.6s with smooth ease-out for legibility.

Reference checklist per landing sections
- Hero: hero-frame, hero-video, hero-video__overlay, text-hero, headline-gradient, btn--primary
- Features: card, text-caption, container-page
- Echo: card, text-eyebrow, section-anchor
- Playbook: prose, card, list styles
- Metrics: metric component, graph-surface, grid-ticks, brand-glow sparingly
- How It Works: card, text-caption
- CTA: cta component, btn--primary, btn--secondary
- FAQ: card, details/summary structure
- Footer: footer component, link classes

By following the utilities and components above, you can implement the full Exit Strategy Echo landing page with a cohesive dark, glassy, luxurious visual language that’s consistent, accessible, and fast.

<main-layout>
# MainLayout — Application Shell and Navigation

The MainLayout component provides the shared application frame for the Exit Strategy Echo landing site. It renders:
- A glass, sticky top navigation bar with brand logo, anchor links, an account switcher, and responsive collapse behavior.
- A centered content column for page content (children), respecting full-page and no-margins display modes via hooks.
- A dark, luxurious visual language using the Tailwind v4 theme and custom utilities.

This layout is used by the top-level App component to wrap all pages and should only accept a single `children` prop that renders the current screen/page.

---

## Responsibilities

- Render a consistent dark, glassy page shell with a sticky top nav.
- Provide anchor-based navigation for the single-page landing layout.
- Collapse navigation into a mobile panel with an “expand” button.
- Include an account switcher in the main nav.
- Honor layout modes:
  - Fullscreen (hide nav and shared UI) using `useIsInFullPageMode`.
  - No margins (edge-to-edge content) using `useIsNoMarginMode`.

---

## Navigation links

Primary anchor navigation (in-header)
- Hero — /#hero
- Features — /#features
- Echo — /#echo
- Playbook — /#playbook
- Metrics — /#metrics
- How It Works — /#how-it-works
- FAQ — /#faq
- Get a Demo — /#cta (primary CTA button)

Secondary links (typically in footer, not in-header)
- Privacy — /privacy
- Terms — /terms
- X — https://x.com
- LinkedIn — https://www.linkedin.com

Note: The landing is a single statically generated page at /. All primary navigation items are in-page anchors for smooth scrolling.

---

## Component API

Props
- children: React.ReactNode — Required. Renders the current page inside the layout’s content region.

Exports
- Named export: `MainLayout`
- Supporting named exports: `MainNav`, `AccountSwitcher`

## Display modes and layout behavior

- Fullscreen mode
  - When `useIsInFullPageMode()` returns true:
    - Hide the main navigation and any shared UI.
    - Keep the page content mounted; do not change render order.

- No margins mode
  - When `useIsNoMarginMode()` returns true:
    - Remove default content margins and paddings.
    - Allow pages to span edge-to-edge (useful for full-bleed sections, e.g., hero video).

- Default mode
  - Pages render within a centered column using `container-page` and vertical stacking (`flex flex-col`) to avoid overflow.

- The layout applies theme utilities:
  - Root: `bg-page` for background, dark theme, and global typography.
  - Navbar: `glass`, `hairline` for glassmorphism and a subtle top divider.
  - Buttons: `btn`, `btn--primary` for CTAs, respecting the brand rule (brand color used sparingly).

---

## Accessibility

- The mobile expand button uses:
  - aria-controls and aria-expanded
  - sr-friendly labels via button aria-label
- The account switcher uses:
  - role="menu" and role="menuitem" semantics
  - Esc to close the dropdown
  - Click outside to dismiss
- Links and interactive elements have `focus-ring` for keyboard navigation.

---

## Usage in the Next.js App component

Place this file at: pages/_app.tsx

```tsx
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { MainLayout } from "@/components/layout/MainLayout";
import "@/styles/globals.css";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
    return (
        <MainLayout>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </MainLayout>
    );
}
```

---

## Visual and theming notes

- Use brand color (#752E4F) sparingly. It is applied mainly to:
  - Primary CTA backgrounds (Get a Demo button).
  - Thin borders or subtle accents (brand-border) where needed.
- Prefer stacking layouts (`flex-col`) and responsive blocks over wide grids to prevent overflow.
- The navbar is glassy and minimal with sharp rounding and thin borders, aligning to the style guide.
- Smooth scrolling and anchor linking are supported by the in-page anchors
  - /#hero, /#features, /#echo, /#playbook, /#metrics, /#how-it-works, /#faq, /#cta.

---

## Checklist

- Named exports for layout components (MainLayout, MainNav, AccountSwitcher).
- Single `children` prop renders current page.
- Sticky, glass, responsive nav with:
  - Logo
  - Anchor links
  - Primary “Get a Demo” CTA
  - Account switcher
  - Mobile expand/collapse
- Honors layout modes via hooks:
  - Fullscreen hides nav.
  - No-margins removes container spacing.
- Compliant with Tailwind v4 theme utilities and dark, glassy, luxurious visual language.

## Sections
Sections are created as individual React components and stored in the `components/sections` directory
and can be imported using an import statement like `import { [ComponentName] } from "@/components/sections/[ComponentName]".

Section Component Rules:

- Use an HTML section tag as root element
- Do not export as default export
- Content in sections should be placed in a centered column
- Background images of section should span the full width of the section and can be wider than the max width of the section
- No external component libraries should be used
- Export section component as a named export using the function keyword
- section components should not define any props

Hero — Section Component
- Description: Marketing hero section introducing Exit Strategy Echo with a right-aligned background video and overlayed headline, subheadline, and CTAs. Emphasizes “square with a circle inside” motif via a floating SVG accent. Optimized for dark, glassy, luxurious aesthetic with gradient text treatments and legible overlays.
- Anchor/Route: #hero
- Structure:
  - Root element is a section with id="hero".
  - Responsive grid: 1 column on small screens; 3 columns on large with the video spanning the right two-thirds.
  - Text content overlays the video on small screens via absolute positioning and gradient overlay; becomes static in the left column on large screens.
  - Includes a geometric SVG accent (square with inner circle) floating over the video on large screens.
- Content:
  - Eyebrow: “Exit Strategy Echo”
  - Headline: “Capture what they know. Keep it working.”
  - Subheadline: Positioning statement for Echo + Playbook.
  - CTAs:
    - Primary: “Get a Demo” linking to #cta with an icon.
    - Secondary: “See How It Works” linking to #how-it-works with an icon.
- Behavior/Interactions:
  - Video: autoplay, muted, loop, playsInline; overlay for legibility using hero-video__overlay.
  - Uses lucide-react icons Mail and ChevronRight.
  - Maintains stacking layout to avoid horizontal overflow on narrow screens.
- Styling:
  - Dark theme, glassmorphism, gradient headline (text-hero, headline-gradient).
  - Classes: hero-frame, hero-video, hero-video__overlay, container-page, text-eyebrow, text-subtitle, btn btn--primary, btn btn--secondary.
  - Brand color (#752E4F) used sparingly for accents and the primary CTA background.
- Accessibility:
  - Clear text overlays with contrast-preserving gradient background on smaller screens.
  - Buttons support keyboard focus via theme focus-ring utility.
- Assets:
  - Hero video: /videos/hero.mp4
- Import:
  - import { Hero } from "@/components/sections/Hero";
- Props:
  - None (section components do not accept props).



SectionTwo — Metrics & Impact
- Description: Animated, glassy metrics section showing count-up tiles, a semi-circle gauge, and branded graph surfaces. Communicates measurable continuity benefits with motion and clarity.
- Anchor/Route: #metrics
- Structure:
  - Root element is a section with id="metrics".
  - Centered content via container-page with stacked, responsive grids:
    - Header with eyebrow, title, and caption.
    - Top row: semi-circle gauge card + 4 metric tiles (count-up).
    - Bottom row: knowledge-retained bars + onboarding-time reduction area chart.
- Behavior/Animations:
  - IntersectionObserver triggers once at 25% visibility to activate animations.
  - Count-up values animate 0 → target with ease-out cubic over ~1.3–1.5s.
  - Gauge uses an SVG semi-arc with stroke-dashoffset animation and brand gradient.
  - Bars animate heights in sequence with small delays; area chart reveals via clip-path.
- Styling:
  - Dark, glassmorphic graph surfaces with subtle grid ticks (graph-surface, grid-ticks, brand-glow).
  - Accent lines and fills use brand color sparingly; primary brand emphasis in CTA contexts only.
  - Cards use card/card--accent with thin borders and sharp rounding.
- Content (examples):
  - Gauge: “Knowledge locked in individuals” at 42% (animated).
  - Metric tiles:
    - Knowledge Retained — 92%
    - Days Faster Onboarding — 45
    - Weeks to Competency — 3
    - Answer Confidence — 96%
  - Graphs:
    - Knowledge Retained (progressive bars)
    - Onboarding Time Reduction (branded area chart)
- Accessibility:
  - Gauge includes an accessible <title> bound via aria-labelledby.
  - Animated numbers are readable and stabilized after animation completes.
- Implementation Notes:
  - Uses a local cn utility for className composition.
  - Ambient backdrop brand-tinted radial gradients are rendered behind content for depth.
  - Animations are client-only and run once per visit to prevent distraction.
- Import:
  - import { SectionTwo } from "@/components/sections/SectionTwo";
- Props:
  - None (section components do not accept props).
