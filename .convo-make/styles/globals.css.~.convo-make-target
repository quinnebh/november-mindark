## theMindArk.AI — Exit Strategy Echo Landing Page

A high-level, content-first plan for the marketing homepage that introduces Exit Strategy Echo: a modular system for capturing and preserving institutional knowledge by replicating an exiting employee as a digital assistant (“Echo”) and generating an onboarding playbook.

---

## Mission

Capture and preserve departing employees’ knowledge, then make it accessible:
- Echo: An AI assistant mirroring the exiting employee, available for teammates after the employee leaves.
- Onboarding Playbook: A clear, structured markdown document new hires can follow to learn the role quickly.

This page is the primary marketing landing and focuses on clarity, credibility, and conversion.

---

## Features

- Echo (AI Replica of Exiting Employee)
  - Mirrors the exiting employee’s knowledge and style.
  - Provides answers to role-specific questions after the employee departs.
  - Enables continuity across projects, processes, and tribal knowledge.

- Onboarding Playbook (Markdown)
  - A structured document capturing responsibilities, workflows, tools, and FAQs.
  - Clear, skimmable sections designed for day-one usability.
  - Becomes a living reference that complements the Echo.

- Hero Video Showcase
  - Immersive background/foreground interplay with text overlay.
  - Video placed on the right two-thirds of the hero; text runs on top of it.
  - Uses /videos/hero.mp4 and a modern, glassy dark theme presentation.

- Animated Impact Metrics (SectionTwo)
  - Graph values animate from 0 to their final values to illustrate impact.
  - Updated graph background colors to align with the app’s dark, glassmorphism styling and brand accents.

- Modern, Luxurious UI
  - Dark mode by default, gradient backgrounds, and glassmorphism.
  - Minimal, sharp rounding with subtle depth and motion.
  - Brand color #752E4F used sparingly for emphasis and primary CTAs.

- Static, Fast, Reliable
  - Built with React + Next.js (pages directory), statically generated for reliability and speed.
  - Tailwind v4 for consistent design system and responsive layout.

- Clear Calls-to-Action
  - Conversion-focused CTAs for “Get a Demo” and “See How It Works.”
  - Scannable content and anchor navigation for a concise single-page flow.

## Content Details

### Hero

- Layout
  - Video on the right two-thirds of the screen.
  - Headline and subheadline flow over the video (text overlays), ensuring legibility through a subtle dark gradient overlay and backdrop blur where needed.
  - The initial motif “Square with a circle inside of it” is represented as a framed, minimal geometric container for the video to hint at structure + human knowledge (“Echo”).
- Media
  - Video URL: /videos/hero.mp4
- Copy Direction
  - Headline: “Capture what they know. Keep it working.”
  - Subheadline: “Replicate departing employees as secure, AI-powered Echos and generate an onboarding playbook that lasts.”
  - Primary CTA: “Get a Demo”
  - Secondary CTA: “See How It Works”

### Features Overview

- Two stacked focus areas:
  - Echo — the AI replica available post-departure.
  - Onboarding Playbook — a structured, markdown-based guide for new hires.
- Each block includes a concise description and one supporting benefit.

### Echo (AI Assistant)

- Emphasis on mirroring knowledge, tone, and decision context of the exiting employee.
- Scenarios:
  - “What’s the escalation path for Vendor X?”
  - “How do we deploy the Q3 reporting pipeline?”
  - “Which stakeholders must approve this contract?”

### Onboarding Playbook

- Organized as markdown for portability and clarity.
- Example outline:
  - Role Overview
  - Core Responsibilities
  - Daily/Weekly/Monthly Routines
  - Key Systems and Access
  - Processes and SOPs
  - Stakeholders and Communication
  - FAQs and Troubleshooting

### Metrics & Impact (SectionTwo)

- Animation
  - All numeric values animate from 0 to their target to showcase momentum and impact.
  - Duration and easing tuned for legibility (e.g., 1.2–1.6s with smooth ease-out).
- Visual Style
  - Graph backgrounds updated to match the dark, glassmorphic palette.
  - Use brand color #752E4F sparingly for highlights, tick accents, or a thin border to call attention—not as a full graph fill except for a primary CTA chart.
- Sample Graphs
  - Knowledge Retained (% coverage)
  - Onboarding Time Reduction (days)
  - Time-to-Competency (weeks)
  - Answer Confidence (score)

### How It Works

- Step 1: Capture Knowledge
  - Interview prompts, document imports, and structured Q&A sessions with the exiting employee.
- Step 2: Create Echo + Playbook
  - Echo becomes the AI assistant; Playbook generates a clear reference for new hires.
- Step 3: Deploy to Team
  - Share Echo access and onboard new hires with the Playbook.

### CTA

- Strong, primary CTA using the brand color as a background.
- Secondary CTA link styled with a thin brand-colored border to indicate alternative action without competing.

### FAQ

- Example questions:
  - “What happens when the exiting employee is unavailable for clarifications?”
  - “Is the Echo limited to predefined topics?”
  - “How is the Playbook maintained over time?”

---

## Visual and Interaction Design

- Theme: Dark, modern, minimal, luxurious.
- Style: Glassmorphism with backdrop blur, subtle gradients, thin borders, and sharp corners.
- Color: Brand #752E4F reserved mainly for primary CTAs and tasteful borders.
- Motion: Gentle float animations for geometric accents and shimmer for interactive elements (e.g., CTA hover).
- Typography:
  - Hero headline: large, responsive (72px desktop, 48px mobile), with a gradient text treatment.
  - Subtitles and captions use semantic classes for hierarchy and readability.

---

## Technical and Implementation Notes

- Tech Stack
  - React, Next.js (pages directory), Tailwind v4, lucide-react.
  - Static Site Generation only; no server-side rendering.
- Layout Preferences
  - Stacking layouts with flex columns to avoid horizontal overflow.
  - Avoid long button labels; use icons when possible.
  - If buttons need text, do not enforce fixed widths.
- Structure
  - Single landing page at / with anchor-based sections for navigation.
  - No usage of the App Router; strictly the pages directory.
  - Named exports by default for components; Next.js pages export default as the page component.
- Styling
  - Apply gradient backgrounds and glass overlays with Tailwind utilities.
  - Maintain consistent dark scales, border opacities, and semantic text colors.
- Motion and Interaction
  - Animate metrics from 0 to final values on viewport intersection.
  - Update graph backgrounds to match dark/glass theme with subtle depth and contrast.

<coding-rules>
## Tech Stack
- ReactJS
- NextJS - pages directory and static site generation
- Tailwinds v4
- lucide-react - icons

## Layout
It is preferred to use stacking layouts using flex-box columns to avoid running out of horizontal
room. Avoid long names in buttons and prefer to use icons for buttons.

If buttons display text DO NOT give the button a static width.

## Static site generation
The frontend of the app uses static site generation so no server side rendering should be used. All
pages are stored in the pages directory and the NextJS app router is NOT used.

## Exports
Always use named exports unless explicitly told otherwise or required such as when creating NextJS
pages.


## Full screen screens
The `useFullPage` hook can be used to display a full screen page without the main navigation bar.

example:
``` tsx
import { useFullPage } from "@/lib/hooks";

function ExampleComponent(){

    useFullPage();

    return (
        <div></div>
    )
}
```

## Form Data
When creating forms store form data in a typed useState variable.

Zod schemas can be imported from `@/lib/schema` to validate types stored in the database.

Form state example:
``` tsx

interface NewsletterForm
{
    name:string
    email:string;
}
function ExampleComponent()
{
    const [newsletterData,setNewsletterData]=useState<NewsletterForm>({
        name:'',
        email:'',
    });

    return (
        <form>
            <input
                placeholder="Enter name"
                value={newsletterData.name}
                onChange={e=>setNewsletterData({...newsletterData,name:e.target.value})}
            />
            <input
                placeholder="Enter email"
                value={newsletterData.email}
                onChange={e=>setNewsletterData({...newsletterData,email:e.target.value})}
            />
        </form>
    )
}
```

## Pages
When creating NextJS pages export the page component as a default function with the function
name reflecting the name of the page.

Do not use the MainLayout component when creating a page. The Main Layout component will be
used by the top level App component.

Include the name of the page in the className of the root element of the page component using the
format of: "page--{PageComponentName}"

Example Page with a route of "/example":
``` tsx

export default function ExamplePage(){

    return (
        <div className="page--ExamplePage">
            Example page content
        <div>
    )
}
```

## Main Layout
The `MainLayout` component is used by the top level `App` component to render the main layout of the
app. By default the MainLayout should render pages in a centered column with a navigation bar.

### Main Layout Display modes
Pages can use the `useFullPage` and `useNoMargins` hooks to alter the way the page is displayed.
Implement display modes using css or class names, DO NOT change the render order or do anything
that would cause the page to be unmounted.

### Main Layout Fullscreen Mode
Pages can request to enter into fullscreen. Use the `useIsInFullPageMode` hook imported from 
`@/lib/hooks` to check if the page should be displayed in fullscreen mode. If useIsInFullPageMode
returns true hide the main navigation and any other UI other than the page content.

### Main Layout No Margins Mode
Pages can request to remove all page margins so that they can display content edge to edge. Use
the `useIsNoMarginMode` hook imported from `@/lib/hooks` to check if the page should be displayed
in no margins mode.


## Packages
This is the package.json file for the project. You can only use libraries based on the dependencies
of the package.json file.

``` json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lucide-react": "^0.544.0",
    "markdown-it": "^14.1.0",
    "next": "15.5.4",
    "react": "19.1.0",

  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4",
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^19",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19",
    "tailwindcss": "^4",
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}


```

## Standard Components
The following components can be used

### Logo
Displays the apps logo using an SVG

Import: `import { Logo } from "@/components/Logo";`
Props:
``` ts
interface LogoProps
{
    color?:string;
    /**
     * @default "w-8 h-8"
     */ 
    className?:string;
    size?:string|number;
}
```

## Utility Functions
The following utility functions can be imported from `@/lib/util`

``` ts
export type ClassNameValue = string | false | number | null | undefined | {
    [className: string]: any;
} | ClassNameValue[];

/**
 * Combines class names and ignores falsy values.
 */
export const cn=(...classNames:ClassNameValue[]):string=>;
```


## Hooks
React components can use the following hooks imported from `@/lib/hooks`

``` ts
/**
 * Hides common UI controls such as the main nav bar.
 * @param enabled If false the hook is disabled
 */
export const useFullPage=(enabled=true)=>;

/**
 * Removes all margins and paddings from the main layout while keeping the main navigation and
 * other shared UI elements
 * @param enabled If false the hook is disabled
 */
export const useNoMargins=(enabled=true)=>;

/**
 * Returns true if the page should be displayed in full screen
 */
export const useIsInFullPageMode=():boolean=>{
    const count=useSubject(fullPageSubject);
    return count>0;
}

/**
 * Returns true if the page should remove all margins
 */
export const useIsNoMarginMode=():boolean=>;
```
</coding-rules>

<styling>
## Styling Framework
Use Tailwinds for styling

## Look and Feel
- modern luxurious
- glassmorphism
- minimalistic
- dark theme
- dark mode by default
- gradient backgrounds
- sharp, minimal rounding

## Custom Color Palette
- Brand color: #752E4F
- Dark scales: (50-900) for consistent theming
- Glass colors for translucent overlays
- Border colors with varying opacity levels
- Semantic text colors (primary, secondary, muted, etc.)

## Typography System
- Hero text styles with gradient effects
- Responsive sizing (72px desktop, 48px mobile)
- Letter spacing and weight variations
- Subtitle and caption utility classes

## Advanced Features
- Backdrop blur utilities (xs through xl)
- Float animations for geometric accents
- Shimmer effects for interactive elements

## Rules
Use the brand color sparingly. The brand color should only use as a background for the most important elements.
The brand color can be used as a thin border color in situations where an element should be highlighted
but is not a main CTA.

<tailwind-rules>
# Tailwind
Always be sure to use Tailwind v4 syntax

## Top level imports
The top of the globals.css file should be formatted as the following:
``` css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?{QUEREY_PARAMS_HERE}");
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography";
```

Additional plugins may be added after the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin.

## Utility classes
Tailwind utility classes must be defined using `@utility` directive instead of the older v3 method
of using `@layer utility`. Any class used in an `@apply` directive must be defined as a utility
class, classed defined in `@layer components` can not be used in the `@apply` directive.

Utility classes can not use Pseudo-class or Pseudo-element selectors. Pseudo selectors should be
apply in the class name of the element using the utility class or in the components applying the
utility

Example of how NOT to use pseudo classes and pseudo elements with utility classes selectors:
<bad-examples>
@utility input-base:hover{
    outline:1px solid var(--color-brand);
}
@utility input-base::placeholder{
    color:var(--muted);
}
</bad-examples>

Example of how to use pseudo classes and pseudo elements with utility classes selectors:
<good-examples>
@utility input-base-hover{
    outline:1px solid var(--color-brand);
}
@utility input-base-placeholder{
    color:var(--muted);
}

@layer components{
    .input:hover{
        @apply input-base-hover;
    }
    .input::placeholder{
        @apply input-base-placeholder;
    }
}
</good-examples>

## Utility class values with spaces
When using utility classes that define arbitrary values and the values contain a space remember to
replace the spaces with underscores.

Utility class value with space example:
``` css
.example{
    @apply bg-[url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg_width='12'_height='8'_viewBox='0_0_12_8'_xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cpath_d='M1_1.5L6_6.5L11_1.5'_stroke='%236b7280'_stroke-width='1.5'_stroke-linecap='round'_stroke-linejoin='round'/%3E%3C/svg%3E")];
}
```

## Components
If a component has multiple variants with shared styles define a "base" utility class to apply to
the variants.

Utility and component class example:
``` css
@utility btn-base{
    border:1px solid var(--border-color);
}

@layer components{
    .btn{
        @apply btn-base;
    }
}
```
