# Exit Strategy Echo (Modular Framework)

Our mission: Provide a system for capturing knowledge of employees exiting an organization by replicating the employee as a digital assistant known as an "Echo".

The exiting employees knowledge will be used for the following:
- Echo: An AI assistant that will mirror the exiting employee and can be used by other employees after the exiting employee leaves
- Onboarding Playbook: A markdown document that will help new employees during onboarding to learn the exiting employee's job.

This site is just the marketing main page.
